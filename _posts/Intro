Hey there. 
My name is Roman. I am 3d artist. I started more and more use automatisation in my work, because it helps make things faster and better. Very often I see the algorhytm how to do some work automatically, but because I don't know any programmers language, it always stopped me from writing it. 
Also I see many other ways to apply the programming skills if I will get them.
So, I decided to learn programming. 
And, because this experience is unique for me, I want to note it here. Also because its free on GitHub Pages, I am writing it here, so somebody can read it and take some useful information from my experience.
